/**
 * Represents an abstract generator for song harmonies. Normally, song harmonies are a sequence
 * of chords (often with the same length) with a certain pattern.
 * The song's complete chord sequence can be divided into repeating sections.
 * For example, a chord sequence might consist of a chord section for
 * a verse and a (possibly longer or shorter) chord section for a refrain,
 * which could each be repeated a couple of times. These chord sections
 * splits the chord sequence into a number of logical parts.
 * 
 * For each tick, this generator must return the current chord, the remaining
 * number of ticks this chord will be played before a chord change occurs (or the
 * song ends) and the number of ticks before a new chord section begins (or the
 * song ends).
 * 
 * The methods must always return consistent (i.e., non-contradictory) results.
 * In addition, the results must be persistent, i.e., a given instance must always
 * return the same results for each method parameter.
 * 
 * Consider a simple chord section of "Am F F Am" with 16 ticks each. If this
 * section is used twice ("Am F F Am Am F F Am"), the two consecutive F and Am
 * chords must be merged together, even though a new chord section begins between
 * the two consecutive Am chords. If it is important for the caller to see chord
 * changes as well as chord section changes, simply use Math.min(getChordTicks(tick),
 * getChordSectionTicks(tick)).
 * 
 * This should result in the following method behavior:
 * 
 * tick   getChord()  getChordTicks()  getChordSequenceTicks()
 * 
 *   0            Am               16                       64
 *  16             F               32                       48
 *  32             F               16                       32
 *  48            Am               32                       16
 *  64            Am               16                       64
 *  80             F               32                       48
 *  96             F               16                       32
 * 112            Am               16                       16
 * 128     undefined        undefined                undefined
 * 
 * Note that each tick (not only multiples of 16 as shown here) must
 * return correct results. The undefined result is due to the fact that
 * an invalid tick is used (128 is the end of the song).
 * 
 * It is very important to get the method behavior correct. The HarmonyEngine
 * can be sanity-checked using checkSanitiy().
