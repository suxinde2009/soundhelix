/**
 * Represents an abstract generator for note sequences. This class provides
 * a dummy implementation of RandomSeedable, which is a no-op (it stores the
 * random seed and can return the stored seed, but doesn't use the seed). Subclasses
 * that want to make use of random-seedability must override setRandomSeed() and
 * getRandomSeed() accordingly. This is to make sure that a subclass is able to
 * react to calls to setRandomSeed() to re-seed the internal random generators, if
 * needed.
