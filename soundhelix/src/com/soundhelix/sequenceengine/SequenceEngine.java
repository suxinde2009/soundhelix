 * random seed and can return the stored seed, but doesn't use the seed). Subclasses
 * that want to make use of random-seedability must override setRandomSeed() and
 * getRandomSeed() accordingly. This is to make sure that a subclass is able to
 * react to calls to setRandomSeed() to re-seed the internal random generators.
