Change log
----------

0.0.5:
    - Set base URL (xml:base) is now set correctly when XML documents are parsed. This means that
      XInclude can now be used properly. All relative URLs referenced in the XML documents are now
      relative to the document URL. The example has been changed accordingly.
 
    - The command-line version of SoundHelix now accepts document URLs as well instead of only files, so XML files
      can be referenced by using HTTP URLs directly

    - The RandomPatternEngine now also supports wildcards as offsets.

    - Added song name text field to the applet. A new song with a given name can be created by entering it into the field.


0.0.4: 2011-01-15

    - Added a first version of a JNLP-based applet. The applet is available at
      http://www.soundhelix.com/applet/SoundHelix-applet.jnlp

    - Added support for song name generation. Each XML file now requires a songNameEngine tag.

    - A song can now be recreated by specifying its song name.


0.0.3: 2010-11-11

    - Corrected small problems regarding random initialization.

    - Made run scripts play examples/SoundHelix-Piano.xml if no parameters are given.

0.0.2: 2010-11-07

    - Added possibility to specify more than one MIDI device name for the MIDI player; SoundHelix will take the first
      one available on your system.
      
    - Updated example.
