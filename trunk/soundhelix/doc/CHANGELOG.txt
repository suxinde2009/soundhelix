?.?.?: unreleased

    - Added a better random seed augmentation scheme. Now random seeds from a component are passed on to subcomponents by
      augmenting the value with a hash value of the implementation class of the subcomponent and the position of the subcomponent
      within the parent component. This makes sure that each subcomponent receives a different random seed with very high
      probability.

    - The DrumSequenceEngine now supports using pitch offsets relative to the base pitch. For example, if the base pitch is
      36, using "0" in the pattern uses pitch 36, "1" uses pitch 37, etc.

    - Removed the RhythmSequenceEngine, because it was not configurable and not really usable. Use the DrumSequenceEngine instead.

    - Added a new PatternEngine called RandomFragmentPatternEngine. This PatternEngine can be used for example to generate
      drum patterns. It gives you more control over the results than the RandomPatternEngine by building a pattern by concatenating
      provided pattern fragments, but does not support random velocity generation.

    - Added the constraints startBeforeSection and stopAfterSection to the SimpleArrangementEntry, which are the counterparts of
      startAfterSection and stopBeforeSection, respectively.

    - The RandomSequenceEngine and the RandomPatternSequenceEngine are now deprecated (they will be removed in a future
      version). Consider using the RandomPatternEngine or RandomFragmentPatternEngine with a different SequenceEngine instead.

    - Added pseudo LFO controller "milliBPM" to the MidiPlayer. This allows changing the BPM during playback using an LFO. Note
      that this has some side-effects on other time-dependent LFOs, because the BPM are used as the time basis.

    - Re-implemented the ArpeggioSequenceEngine to use PatternEngines.

    - Improved example. The example now uses the RandomFragmentPatternEngine for the percussion.


0.0.5: 2011-02-27

    - The command-line version of SoundHelix now accepts document URLs as well instead of only files, so XML files
      can be referenced by using HTTP/HTTPS/FTP URLs directly. Note that HTTPS requires special JVM configuration.

    - The base URL (xml:base) is now set correctly when XML documents are parsed. This means that
      XInclude can now be used properly. All relative URLs referenced in the XML documents are now
      relative to the including document URLs. The example has been changed to source out the SongNameEngine and
      the HarmonyEngine configuration as separate documents.
 
    - The RandomPatternEngine now also supports wildcards as offsets. Useful for all SequenceEngines which allow wildcards
      (e.g., the MelodySequenceEngine).

    - Introduced "version" attribute for the XML root tag. If present, the application version will be checked against the
      specified version of the tag. If the version attribute ends with a "+" (e.g., "0.0.5+"), the application version must
      be at least the given version, otherwise the versions must match exactly.

    - Added escaping support for splitting strings. For example, now commas in MIDI device names can be escaped by preceding
      them with a backslash.

    - Fixed inconsistent XML structure of the "lfo" tag of the MidiPlayer. The tag is now called "controllerLFO" without
      a "class" attribute, and it has (among others) a subtag called "lfo" with a "class" attribute. Fix your XML files accordingly.

    - Fixed inconsistency in the controllerLFO/channel tag of the MidiPlayer (channels were numbered from 0-15 instead of
      1-16 like in the "map" tag). Fix your XML files accordingly by increasing the LFO channels by 1.

    - Added random seedability and XML configurability to the LFO interface.

    - Added song name text field to the applet. A new song with a given name can be created by entering it into the field,
      with the song name being used as the random seed.

    - Added buttons for Facebook and Twitter to applet, which lets you share the current song easily on Facebook/Twitter.

    - Added buttons for YouTube and SoundHelix to applet, which lets you visit the SoundHelix YouTube channel and the SoundHelix website

    - Added tooltips to all text fields and buttons in the applet.

    - Updated included log4j version from 1.2.8 to 1.2.16.

    - Improved example.


0.0.4: 2011-01-15

    - Added a first version of a JNLP-based applet. The applet is available at
      http://www.soundhelix.com/applet/SoundHelix-applet.jnlp

    - Added support for song name generation. Each XML file now requires a songNameEngine tag.

    - A song can now be recreated by specifying its song name.


0.0.3: 2010-11-11

    - Corrected small problems regarding random initialization.

    - Made run scripts play examples/SoundHelix-Piano.xml if no parameters are given.

    - Updated example.


0.0.2: 2010-11-07

    - Added possibility to specify more than one MIDI device name for the MIDI player; SoundHelix will take the first
      one available on your system.
      
    - Updated example.


0.0.1: 2010-11-02

    - Initial release
