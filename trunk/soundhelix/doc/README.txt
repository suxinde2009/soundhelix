Introduction
------------

SoundHelix is a framework for algorithmic music creation and playback.

In 1995, I started working on a similar software on the Amiga platform,
called AlgoMusic, which was published on Aminet and was improved over
a couple of releases until 1998. Then I stopped development due
to lack of time. Due to the focus on and limitations of the standard Amiga
audio hardware, AlgoMusic itself was very limited and inflexible.

SoundHelix has a similar goal, but strives to remove most (if not all)
of the limitations of AlgoMusic. Due to its nature as a framework, it
is possible to plug-in own implementations of most components.

SoundHelix is a Java rewrite from scratch which offers a whole lot of
flexibility and customization capabilities. It is also a framework
which allows other developers to easily write their own music creation
components and use them within SoundHelix.

SoundHelix features some basic music creation abilities and a MIDI
player, which can access any MIDI resource accessible to Java. Currently,
some external MIDI software is required for playback. This can be any
MIDI software or hardware which can be accessed using a MIDI driver on
your platform. You can even use the standard Java Software Synthesizer or
the Windows Wavetable Software Synth. It is possible to use any number of
MIDI devices in parallel for playback. Please check the included configuration
files.

Note that SoundHelix might require some configuration time to produce good
results on your MIDI setup. You shouldn't expect excellent results out-of-the-box.

The best of all: SoundHelix is free and fun!


Requirements
------------

End users:

- Java Runtime Environment 5 or later
- a MIDI playback device or MIDI-capable software
- some MIDI hub software (optional)


Developers:

- Java Software Development Kit 5 or later
- ant (http://ant.apache.org)
- Subversion client (http://subversion.tigris.org)
- Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org, optional)


Building and running SoundHelix
-------------------------------

Download the source code (or get it using a Subversion client) and store
it in any location on your harddrive. Then just run "ant" in SoundHelix'
main directory, which is the directory containing the ant build script
(build.xml). After building, a JAR file (SoundHelix.jar) will have been
created in that directory.

In order to run SoundHelix, simply run "run.bat" (Windows) or "run.sh"
(Unix/Linux). You can optionally provide the name of the configuration file
to use as a parameter.


Installing a MIDI Hub
---------------------

Some MIDI software (like Propellerhead Reason) does not offer a
MIDI device itself, but can connect to a present MIDI device to receive
MIDI messages. SoundHelix also does not make itself visible as a MIDI device,
so neither can SoundHelix connect to the MIDI software nor can the MIDI
software connect to SoundHelix. In this case, you must install some MIDI hub
software as a man-in-the-middle, for example MIDI Yoke (available for
Windows, other platforms offer similar MIDI hub software).

This software simply sets up a MIDI device that is visible from both Java
and from any other MIDI software and relays MIDI messages between
SoundHelix and the MIDI software. SoundHelix must be configured
to use MIDI Yoke as the MIDI output device and the MIDI software
must use MIDI Yoke as the MIDI input device. MIDI Yoke provides
up to 8 MIDI ports. It is sufficient to use one of the ports
for SoundHelix (provided that you don't want use more than 16 MIDI
channels), otherwise you can use more than one port. The name of the
MIDI Yoke MIDI output port is "Out To MIDI Yoke:  n" (with n from
1 to 8) - note the extra space after the colon. This must be used
in SoundHelix for output. The MIDI software can then use "In From
MIDI Yoke:  n" for input.

MIDI Yoke can be found here: http://www.midiox.com/myoke.htm


Configuration
-------------

Configuration is done using an XML file. If no filename is
provided at startup, the file "SoundHelix.xml" is read from the current
directory, otherwise the first parameter given is used as the XML filename
and that file is read. A couple of example configuration files are included
in the "examples" directory.

Details about configuration are still to be written.

Within each XML tag that requires an integer you can use the following
syntax instead of a plain integer:

- <random min="minimum" max="maximum"/>

  to generate a random integer between minimum and maximum
  (both inclusive) with uniform distribution
  
- <random min="minimum" max="maximum" type="normal" mean="mean" variance="variance"/>

  to generate a random integer between minimum and maximum (both inclusive)
  with a Gaussian (normal) distribution having a mean of mean and a variance
  of variance; mean and variance are doubles; the mean is optional (if unspecified,
  the arithmetic mean of min and max will be used)
  
- <random list="value1,value2,..."/>

  to randomly select one of the specified values with uniform distribution

Within each XML tag that requires a string, you can use the following instead
of a plain string:

- <random list="string1|string2|..."/>

  to randomly select one of the specified strings with uniform distribution

Note that all of these special tags can only be used in text nodes in the XML file,
i.e., not for attribute values.


Results wanted
--------------

I'm going to collect SoundHelix results from users throughout the world
for publishing them as example results on the SoundHelix webpage.

These are the requirements:

- results must be single songs
- songs must have been generated by SoundHelix only, using any number of
  MIDI devices for playback (no sequencers allowed)
- song lengths must be between 3 and 8 minutes
- songs must be in MP3 format with a bitrate between 128 and 256 KBit/s

Songs will be published with your real name or pseudonym, optionally with
your mail address, and a short description of your setup (operating system,
MIDI software used, etc.).

You can send your results to me by e-mail.

I would also be interested if you manage to let SoundHelix run on mobile
devices with a Java environment, like mobile phones, PDAs or portable MP3
players.
