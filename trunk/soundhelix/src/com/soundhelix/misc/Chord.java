/**
 * Defines a chord. A chord is immutable and consists of 3 different pitches, which cannot span more than 11 halftones. A chord may be one of the
 * common type major, minor, diminished or augmented (all of them in all three inversion flavors) or can have any other pitch combination. All chords
 * can be rotated up or down. Rotating a chord up means replacing the chord's low pitch with the same pitch transposed one octave up. Rotating a chord
 * down means replacing the chord's high pitch with the same pitch transposed one octave down. All common type chords (except for augmented chords)
 * can be normalized, which means that the chords are rotated up or down so that their low pitch equals the root pitch of the chord (e.g., "C4" and
 * "C6" are normalized to "C"), if that is not already the case. Augmented chords cannot be normalized, because they don't have a unique root pitch
 * (e.g., the chords "Caug", "Eaug6" and "G#aug4" are not distinguishable if you look at their pitches).
