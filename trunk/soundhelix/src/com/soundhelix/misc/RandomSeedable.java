/**
 * Simple interface that adds random-seedability to a class. A class that implements this interface, but does not
 * want to use it needs to supply at least a dummy implementation that adheres to the contract described in
 * getRandomSeed(). How the random seed is used is up to the classes that implement this interface. The seed is often
 * used to instantiate a random generator. Note that the class java.util.Random only uses the lower 48 bits of the
 * random seed, but other random generators might make use of the full 64 bits of the seed.
