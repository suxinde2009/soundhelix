/**
 * Defines the logical structure of a song. The logical structure consists of the song's
 * signature (internal note quantization) and the HarmonyEngine.
 * 
 * The main unit is a beat. Beats are divided into ticks (usually 4 ticks form a beat),
 * and beats are grouped into bars (usually 4 beats form a bar), and an integer number of bars
 * forms the song. Ticks are the smallest units of a song.
 * 
 * The song signature is defined by specifying the total number of bars, the number of beats
 * per bar and the number of ticks per beat.
 * 
 * Each point in time within the song is addressed by its tick number (counted from 0). Beats, bars,
 * ticks within a beat and beats within a bar can be derived by using the ticks per beat and
 * the beats per bar, if necessary.
 *
 * Each component must be ready to handle at least the following ticks per beat: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16.
 * For most music types, 3 (3/4 bars) or 4 (4/4 bars) ticks per beat will be fine. In order to mix 3/4 with 4/4
 * notes, one might consider using 12 ticks per beat, so that quarter notes (3 ticks) and third notes
 * (4 ticks) can be used at the same time.
