/**
 * Represents a track. A track consists of an arbitrary number of sequences and a type.
 * The type can either be MELODY, which means that the sequences contain melodic notes
 * which are subject for transposition, or it can be RHYTHM, which means the sequences
 * contain rhythm notes which must never be transposed. For example, for drum machines,
 * RHYTHM must be used, because each pitch of a sequence selects a drum sample to play
 * (c' might be the base drum, c#' might be the snare and so on) rather than a frequency
 * of a tone to play.
 * 
 * Only a whole track can be assigned to an instrument, so all contained sequences use the
 * same instrument for playback. If different instruments are needed, the sequences must each
 * be put into a track individually. The assignment of a whole track to an instrument is
 * also the reason why it doesn't make sense to individually assign the types to sequences.
 * If you have an instrument where part of the keys should use RHYTHM, the others should use
 * MELODY, you should split these off into two different tracks and assign them to the same
 * MIDI channel for playback.
